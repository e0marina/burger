What the app does:
This app allows the user to type in the name of a burger they would like and then they can click the button to 'eat' it. Once it's eaten, the button's text changes to 'that was yummy!'

What is it for:
This app was an exercise for UCLA's extension full-stack program. We learned handlebars in this unit, as well as MVC design.

Technologies / Concepts Used: Javascript, MySQL, Heroku, Handlebars.js, Express, MVC

Future Development: The css is nothing fancy, it functions properly, but in the future I'd like to make it look better.
